/*	 Data members: Employee_Number (an integer), Employee_Name (a 
/*	string of characters), Basic_Salary (an integer) , All_Allowances 
/*	(an integer), IT (an integer), Net_Salary (an integer). 
/*	 Member functions: to read the data of an employee, to calculate 
/*	Net_Salary and to print the values of all the data members. 
/*	 (All_Allowances = 123% of Basic; Income Tax (IT) = 30% of the
